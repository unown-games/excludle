Excludle

Excludle is a daily logic game where your goal is to find the odd one out in each row.
Every puzzle gives you several rows of words or numbers.
Each row secretly shares a category—except for one item.
Your job is to pick the item that does not belong.

Example:

Dog • Cat • Horse • Car • Bird


Hidden category: Animals
Odd one out: Car

You have 3 lives.
Every incorrect guess costs one life.
Solve all rows before running out of lives to win the game.

A new puzzle appears every day at midnight (US Eastern Time).

No account, no sign-in—just a simple daily challenge.
